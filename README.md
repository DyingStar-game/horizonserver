# Horizon usage

## Send a message to all players

To broadcast a message to all players connected in a plugin event part, use:

```rust
let login_announcement = serde_json::json!({
    "type": "user_login",
    "message": format!("User {} has joined the game", username),
    "timestamp": std::time::SystemTime::now().duration_since(std::time::UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap_or_default().as_secs()
});

// Example of how to broadcast from a sync context:
// Method 1: Using tokio::spawn for fire-and-forget broadcasting
{
    let events = events.clone();
    let announcement = login_announcement.clone();
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        if let Ok(client_count) = events.broadcast(&announcement).await {
            info!("ðŸ”§ StarsBeyondPlugin: Broadcasted login announcement to {} clients", client_count);
        } else {
            info!("ðŸ”§ StarsBeyondPlugin: Failed to broadcast login announcement");
        }
    });
}
```

## list of all messages

This is the list of messages exchanged between parts.

## Scenarii


### Player connect to server

The player connect to the server

The payload sent by the client is:

```json
{
    "namespace": "player",
    "event": "init",
    "data": {
        "name":"ddurieux",
        "spawnpoint":0
    }
}
```

The payload received by the Horizon server is:

```json
{
    "namespace": "player",
    "event": "init",
    "player_id": PlayerId,
    "data": {
        "name":"ddurieux",
        "spawnpoint":0
    }
}
```

Horizon will give to the game server the player info
Horizon will give to the client all items to load
Horizon will give to the client the player spwan position
